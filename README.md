# The Pokemon Manager App

This exercise is to challenge **your knowledge of React** through the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the requirements to carry out this exercise.


> **Limit the time** you spend on this exercise **to 3 hours**. Don't worry if you can't finish on time. However, you must be able to explain how you would finish the exercise - and why you would do so - if given more time. Remember that there is no right solution. There will be plenty of time during the interview to give context to the shortcuts you have made.

> **Host your version of this repository** on [Github](https://github.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/) or another platform. Make sure it's **publicly available**. Share the link to the finished exercise.

## Introduction

To keep things light ‚Äî and because the API is publicly available ‚Äî you'll be working with Pok√©mon üéâ. The goal is to develop a single-page application (SPA) that allows you to:

- [Select a Pok√©mon](#select-a-pok√©mon) using a searchable list
- [Select moves](#select-the-moves) for that Pok√©mon to learn (limited to 4 moves)
- [Add the selected Pok√©mon to your squad](#add-to-your-squad) (limited to 6 Pok√©mon)

This exercise is based on Pokemon as you already know, which makes it fun in itself! We wish you happy coding with Pokemon world! üôå

## Specifications

### Select a Pok√©mon

<p>

- Add a text input to filter the list. Pok√©mon whose name match ‚Äî or partially match ‚Äî the input value remain visible. All other Pok√©mon have to be removed from the list. 
- Clicking a Pok√©mon marks it as selected and displays it in the details section.

### Select the moves

![Select the moves](docs/images/select-the-moves.png)

- Use the [GraphQL API](#graphql-api) to get the selected Pok√©mon's details: name, image, stats, moves and type. 
- Present the stats in a 2x3 grid. 
- Divide the moves by way of learning: level-up, tutor, egg and machine. Note that not all Pok√©mon have all 4 types of moves. 
- Clicking a move adds it to the list of selected moves. 
- Clicking an already selected move removes it from the list. 
- Limit the number of moves to 4.

### Add to squad

![Add to squad](docs/images/add-to-squad.png)

- Clicking the button adds the selected Pok√©mon ‚Äî with its selected moves ‚Äî to your squad. 
- Limit the squad to 6 Pok√©mon.

## Technical details

The master branch is your starter kit for the exercise. Clone it and run `yarn` followed by `yarn start`. This should present you with a ready-to-go application. Use the _src_ and _public_ folder to edit or add code.

> **Note**: The package.json includes a predefined set of dependencies. **Feel free to add or remove packages** as needed. Use as much open source components as you like. We recommend [Downshift](https://github.com/paypal/downshift) for the autocomplete UI. You can use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) or [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling. As long as you're able to justify your choices nothing is off limits.

### Prerequisites

This exercise requires [Node >= 12](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn 1](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/).

### Commands

The build command will bundle all assets and output a static version of the website in the _build_ folder. The start command will serve the website and watch for changes.

- Install all dependecies: `yarn` 
- Build: `yarn build` 
- Run: `yarn start` 

### GraphQL API

The GraphQL endpoint URL is `https://p5k91xxvoq.sse.codesandbox.io/`. It's available in your application as `process.env.REACT_APP_POKE_ENDPOINT`. You can use the [Graphql playground](https://p5k91xxvoq.sse.codesandbox.io/) as a documentation resource or to get familiar with the API.

You'll need two queries to build your application: one for listing all Pok√©mons and one for getting a Pok√©mon's details:

#### Pok√©mon List

```gql
Pokemons(first: 151) {
  id
  name
}
```

#### Pok√©mon Details

```gql
Pokemon(name: "snorlax") {
  id
  name
  image
  abilities {
    name
  }
  stats {
    name
    value
  }
  types {
    name
  }
}
```
